# Sorting arrays without the ES6 sort method.

This file contains a few different sorting array excercises. The sorting arrays folder contains a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns a new array with the numbers from the original array sorted highest to lowest.

The Sorting Movies Folder contains a project with a few different functions that take in a list of movie objects and sorts them. One of the functions sorts simply by rank (one of the attributes in each movie object). The other function takes in another argument that asks for a sorting attribute so it is dynamically changing what it is sorting by.
